Idea 3: Homework Tracker

Pitch
This is going to be a homework tracker that is going to send emails to student about the homework and what they are suppose to do and when it is due. A lot of students forget to do their homework, this is because most students don't want to do  their homework and make excuses that they forget, so it will be very nice to get an email or update on which homework is due and what suppose to be done, so students dont have an excuse on why they didn't do their homework.

schedule has everything due tomorrow on it
if it is complete it goes to the bottom of the list

for each due date make a schedule
for each schedule add the assignments due on that day
show the schedule for assignments due the next day

associate schedules with user

schedules start at 5 by default
schedule needs to look at estimated time to complete and sat start/end time
after an assigment insert a break of 5 minutes
